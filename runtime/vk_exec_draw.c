// Draws, binds and dispatches of the Vulkan op-stream replay: the strong
// vk_exec_op_draw behind vk_exec.c's weak hook. The bind ops fill the VkExec slots; a draw opens the pass, resolves the
// bound program to translated shaders (the translator's answers come from the bound state), asks vk_pipeline.c for the
// pipeline, pushes (or allocates) set 0 as VkPipeInfo.bindings says and records the dynamic state, vertex and index
// buffers and the draw. A dispatch ends the pass and does the same for the compute shader. UPDATE_UB is a buffer copy
// from transient memory between full barriers.
//
// Per command buffer the replay keeps transient memory (support buffers, copied uniform ranges, generated indices),
// descriptor pools, image views and the storage-buffer ranges the GPU may write; all of it is freed, and the ranges are
// reported with vk_gpu_written, from one completion callback once the submission's fence is done (the write watch
// does not see GPU writes). The memos and per-command-buffer state belong to one recording context (VkExecDraw); the
// tables the contexts of a chunked replay share (stand-ins, depth twins, views) take their own locks.
//
// Provenance: the op semantics (bind ops, program and slot conventions, draw and dispatch flow, vertex streams with a
// zeroed buffer for unbound ones) follow MacNativeGames games/totk/third_party/d2r_gfx/gfx/nvn/nvn_mtl.m:7409-7460,

// ---- UpdateUniformBuffer inside a pass (TOTK_UB_OVERLAY)
// nvnCommandBufferUpdateUniformBuffer writes a few hundred bytes of constants between draws: the draws recorded after
// it read the new bytes, those before it the old ones. Replayed as a buffer copy at that point it needs a barrier
// against the earlier draws, and a barrier ends the open pass; the terrain and the sky islands' meshes update before
// most of their draws, about 200 updates inside passes in a field submission, each a pass end, a full barrier and a
// pass begin. Here an update inside a pass, and with TOTK_UB_OVERLAY_OUT one between passes, goes into the scratch
// buffer as an overlay: the later bindings of a range it covers bind the scratch bytes (ub_bind, from ubo_info and
// bind_range), and the copies into the real buffers wait for the next full barrier, where the pass has ended anyway
// (vk_exec_ub_flush from vk_exec.c barrier_to: a pass end, a dispatch, a transfer, the end of the submission), behind
// one barrier of their own. Each draw reads the bytes it would have read with the copy in between.
// - A GPU write of another kind (a copy, a fill, a shader's storage write) is ordered with the copies only by the
//   command buffer. vk_exec_ub_foreign notes it and retires the overlays it touches; an update over such bytes takes
//   the old path. A shader that writes a range with copies pending gets them first (ub_written: the pass restarts).
// - An update that takes the old path (outside a pass, a full list) retires the overlays it covers (ov_retire).
// - A binding an overlay covers only in part, or at an offset the binding's alignment refuses, gets a merged scratch
//   copy: the snapshot's bytes (vk_usnap.c) or guest memory, with every update of the submission so far (UPD) on top.
// - The descriptor build skip (bind_sig) hashes the overlay each uniform and storage binding of the draw reads
//   (ov_at), so a draw of an updated block binds the newest bytes and the other draws still skip. The lists are per submission and keep one entry per range (ov_add), and a binding outside their span is
//   answered in one comparison; when one is full, updates take the old path.
// - A chunked replay (vk_exec.c) takes the old path for every update: OV is one list in replay order, which the chunks
//   recording on several threads at once neither share nor could fill in order. Its fence never matches OV.fence, so
//   ub_bind, ub_written, ov_at and vk_exec_ub_flush leave its chunks alone.
